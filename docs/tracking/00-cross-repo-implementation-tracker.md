# Cross-Repo Implementation Tracker

Last updated: 2026-05-02

Coordinator repo: `C:\Users\skull\OneDrive\Documents\OpenZues`

Primary source of truth: `C:\Users\skull\OneDrive\Documents\openclaw-main`

Reference/bridge repos:

- `C:\Users\skull\OneDrive\Documents\hermes-agent-main`
- `C:\Users\skull\OneDrive\Documents\warp-master`

This workspace tracks what is implemented, what is verified, what remains, and
which percentages can move after a checked-off implementation slice. Hermes and
Warp rows are reference/bridge evidence unless a row explicitly targets a
Hermes or Warp integration.

## Status Summary

| Scope | Percent | Status | Source |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Repo-wide OpenClaw parity in OpenZues | ~53.2% | Active, broad parity still open | `docs/openclaw-parity-progress.md`, `docs/openclaw-parity-unresolved-seams.md` |
| Active gateway/session/tool-contract path | ~98.7% | Near-complete bounded local path | `docs/openclaw-parity-progress.md` |
| Chat/session contract subfamily | ~98.3% | Near-complete bounded local path | `docs/openclaw-parity-progress.md` |
| Runtime/CLI/doctor native bridge | ~99.9% | Mostly landed; packaging and installed plugin depth remain | `docs/openclaw-parity-progress.md` |
| Hermes reference surface | 80-85% | Reference-only rough status from repo inspection | `docs/tracking/03-hermes-reference-status.md` |
| Warp reference surface | Mixed | Reference-only; client-local plus backend-gated areas | `docs/tracking/04-warp-reference-status.md` |

## Current Worktree Boundary

The Slack provider-native thread timestamp parity slice is verified and
awaiting its checkpoint commit. Any follow-up changes should target the next
queue head only:

- `src/openzues/services/ops_mesh.py`
- `tests/test_ops_mesh.py`
- `docs/openclaw-parity-progress.md`
- `docs/openclaw-parity-unresolved-seams.md`
- `docs/tracking/00-cross-repo-implementation-tracker.md`
- `docs/tracking/01-openzues-openclaw-parity-status.md`

Known untracked temp/log artifacts are unrelated and must remain unstaged.

## Current Queue

| ID | Area | Status | Percent Impact | Next Action |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| OZ-RM-001 | Sandboxed remote inbound provider media staging | Checkpointed and pushed in `2e6a3ed8` | Repo-wide +0.1%, chat/session +0.1%, gateway session/tool +0.1% | Done; continue `OZ-RT-001` |
| OZ-RT-001 | Runtime-control hard gaps | Checkpointed in `8a0e6ac6` | Repo-wide +0.1%, active gateway/method +0.1% | Small base-method sweep done; rotate to provider/runtime breadth |
| OZ-PKG-001 | Packaging/distribution breadth | Open | Broad | Map Windows-first doctor/package surfaces against OpenClaw |
| OZ-PLUGIN-001 | Real installed plugin module import/activation | Checkpointed in `9fb5098b` | Repo-wide +0.1%, gateway session/tool +0.1% | `plugins.uiDescriptors` done; continue next source-backed plugin/runtime base-method gap |
| OZ-COMP-001 | Companion apps/nodes parity | Open | Broad | Inventory OpenClaw macOS/iOS/Android node behavior and choose first local bridge seam |
| OZ-PROV-001 | Provider-native outbound/inbound breadth | Slack thread timestamp fallback verified; checkpoint pending | Repo-wide +0.1%, active gateway/method +0.1% | Continue provider-specific send/poll/replay metadata gaps |

## Active Slice Detail

- [x] `OZ-RT-001A` `sessions.pluginPatch` registered plugin session extension state
  - Source: `openclaw-main/src/gateway/server-methods/sessions.ts`,

    `src/openzues/services/gateway_plugin_runtime.py`,
    `src/openzues/services/gateway_sessions.py`,
    `src/openzues/services/gateway_method_policy.py`
  - Contract: `sessions.pluginPatch` is admin-only, rejects unregistered
    plugin/namespace pairs, persists JSON-compatible plugin extension state
    by plugin id and namespace, projects registered extension values on
    session rows, and removes state on explicit `unset=true`.
  - Evidence required: focused test, adjacent session-control test, ruff, mypy
  - Status: checkpointed in `e0c02761`
  - Weight: 1
  - Last verified: 2026-05-02, `python -m pytest

    `src/openzues/services/gateway_plugin_runtime.py`,
    `src/openzues/services/gateway_method_policy.py`
  - Contract: `plugins.uiDescriptors` accepts only `{}`, returns
    `{ok: true, descriptors}` from the active plugin runtime registry, stamps
    each descriptor with registry-owned `pluginId` and optional `pluginName`,
    preserves JSON-compatible `schema` and valid `requiredScopes`, and skips
    invalid/disabled descriptor registrations before projection.
  - Evidence required: focused test, adjacent plugin-runtime test, ruff, mypy
  - Status: checkpointed in `9fb5098b`
  - Weight: 1
  - Last verified: 2026-05-02, `python -m pytest

    passed`), `ruff check`, and `mypy`.

- [x] `OZ-RT-001B` TTS persona gateway and CLI methods
  - Source: `openclaw-main/src/gateway/server-methods/tts.ts`,

    `src/openzues/services/gateway_node_methods.py`,
    `src/openzues/services/gateway_method_policy.py`, and
    `src/openzues/cli.py`
  - Contract: `tts.personas` accepts `{}` and returns the active persona plus
    configured persona descriptors; `tts.setPersona` accepts `persona`, clears
    on `off`/`none`/`default`, rejects unknown ids, persists selected persona
    in TTS prefs, projects `persona`/`personas` on status, and exposes matching
    JSON-capable Typer commands.
  - Evidence required: focused gateway/policy/CLI tests, adjacent TTS gateway,
    API, and CLI tests, ruff, mypy
  - Status: checkpointed in `3819d03a`
  - Weight: 1
  - Last verified: 2026-05-02, focused gateway persona tests (`2 passed`),

- [x] `OZ-RT-001C` realtime voice gateway session and relay methods
  - Source: `openclaw-main/src/gateway/server-methods/talk.ts`,
    `openclaw-main/src/gateway/protocol/schema/channels.ts`, and
    `openclaw-main/src/gateway/method-scopes.ts`
  - References: Hermes/Warp `none`
  - Target: `src/openzues/services/gateway_node_methods.py`,
    `src/openzues/services/gateway_method_policy.py`
  - Contract: `talk.realtime.session`, `relayAudio`, `relayMark`,
    `relayStop`, and `relayToolResult` are write-scoped, validate
    OpenClaw-shaped params, dispatch through a fakeable realtime runtime
    adapter when registered, return relay `{ok: true}` responses, and preserve
    OpenClaw-shaped unavailable errors when no realtime provider/relay runtime
    is wired.
  - Evidence required: focused gateway/policy tests, adjacent talk gateway
    tests, ruff, mypy
  - Status: checkpointed in `75d03a6c`
  - Weight: 1
  - Last verified: 2026-05-02, focused gateway realtime tests (`2 passed`),
    focused talk/TTS policy proof (`2 passed`), adjacent `python -m pytest
    tests\test_gateway_node_methods.py -q -k "talk_realtime or talk_speak or
    talk_config"` (`6 passed`), `ruff check`, and `mypy`. A broader policy
    selection exposed unrelated existing gaps for `channels.stop` and
    `node.pair.remove`.

- [x] `OZ-RT-001D` `channels.stop` gateway method
  - Source: `openclaw-main/src/gateway/server-methods/channels.ts` and
    `openclaw-main/src/gateway/method-scopes.ts`
  - References: Hermes/Warp `none`
  - Target: `src/openzues/services/gateway_node_methods.py`,
    `src/openzues/services/gateway_method_policy.py`
  - Contract: `channels.stop` is admin-scoped, validates `channel` and optional
    `accountId`, normalizes known channel ids, returns `{channel, accountId,
    stopped: true}` as an idempotent native stop boundary, and preserves
    OpenClaw-shaped invalid-channel errors.
  - Evidence required: focused gateway/policy tests, adjacent channel mutation
    tests, ruff, mypy
  - Status: checkpointed in `64f6937a`
  - Weight: 1
  - Last verified: 2026-05-02, focused gateway stop tests (`2 passed`),
    focused channel policy proof (`1 passed`), adjacent `python -m pytest
    tests\test_gateway_node_methods.py -q -k "channels_stop or channels_start
    or channels_logout"` (`7 passed`), `ruff check`, and `mypy`. A broader
    channel-status selection exposed an unrelated older catalog expectation for
    Zalo/LINE/Matrix.

- [x] `OZ-RT-001E` `node.pair.remove` gateway method
  - Source: `openclaw-main/src/gateway/server-methods/nodes.ts` and

    `src/openzues/services/gateway_node_methods.py`,
    `src/openzues/services/gateway_method_policy.py`
  - Contract: `node.pair.remove` is pairing-scoped, validates `nodeId`,
    removes a paired node from the native pairing store, returns `{nodeId}`,
    rejects unknown nodes, and broadcasts `node.pair.resolved` with
    `decision="removed"` and an empty `requestId`.
  - Evidence required: focused gateway/policy tests, adjacent node-pair
    lifecycle tests, ruff, mypy
  - Status: checkpointed in `8a0e6ac6`
  - Weight: 1
  - Last verified: 2026-05-02, focused gateway remove tests (`2 passed`),
    focused node/voice policy proof (`1 passed`), adjacent `python -m pytest

    node_pair_approve or node_pair_reject or node_pair_list or
    node_pair_request or node_pair_verify or node_rename"` (`13 passed`),
    `ruff check`, and `mypy`.

- [x] `OZ-PROV-001A` Slack native route `thread_ts` fallback
  - Source: `openclaw-main/extensions/slack/src/thread-ts.ts`,
    `openclaw-main/extensions/slack/src/thread-ts.test.ts`, and
    `openclaw-main/extensions/slack/src/outbound-adapter.ts`
  - References: Hermes/Warp `none`
  - Target: `src/openzues/services/ops_mesh.py`
  - Contract: Slack native route-backed sends use `replyToId` as Slack
    `thread_ts` only when it matches Slack timestamp format, fall back to a
    valid Slack timestamp `threadId`, and omit invalid internal ids from Slack
    API payloads.
  - Evidence required: focused Slack native route test, adjacent Slack route
    test, ruff, mypy
  - Status: verified; checkpoint commit pending
  - Weight: 1
  - Last verified: 2026-05-02, focused Slack native route tests (`2 passed`),
    adjacent `python -m pytest tests\test_ops_mesh.py -q -k
    "slack_native_route or direct_channel_message_uses_slack or
    slack_reply_to_thread"` (`5 passed`), `ruff check`, and `mypy`.

## Canonical Checklist Format

Use this shape for each bounded seam:

```md
- [ ] Seam name
  - Source: OpenClaw file/test/behavior
  - References: Hermes/Warp paths or `none`
  - Target: OpenZues owner files
  - Contract: input, state change, output, persistence/API/UI behavior
  - Evidence required: focused test, adjacent test, ruff, mypy
  - Status: open | mapped | implemented | verified | checkpointed | blocked
  - Weight: 1 small, 2-3 normal, 5+ broad
  - Last verified: YYYY-MM-DD, command/result
```

Checkbox meanings:

- `[ ]` open
- `[~]` mapped, source/target/proof known
- `[x]` verified with implementation and evidence
- `[!]` blocked by a concrete external blocker

## After-Slice Update Checklist

- [ ] Update the seam checkbox and status.
- [ ] Update percent only if verified weighted numerator changed.
- [ ] Record fully implemented behavior.
- [ ] Record remaining checklist items.
- [ ] Record source, target, and reference paths.
- [ ] Record exact verification command and result.
- [ ] Record the next queue head.
- [ ] Record commit hash after checkpoint.
- [ ] Record push branch/URL only after successful push.
